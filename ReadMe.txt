My game is called Just Shoot Things. It's a top-down arcade-style shooter.
The goal of the game is to survive and kill as many zombies as possible to rack up points to get the highscore (meaning no real, concrete win state.)
As the player gets more and more points, the spawn rate of the zombies increase and the player gets upgrades to help him survive.


The purpose of the game is to make the player feel excitement and the adrenaline while playing the game. The game is designed to be fast-paced and dexterity-heavy.
However, there are certain strategic elements to it in regards to player positioning. Also, there are certain tricks (e.g. jumping and using the shotgun recoil to move faster) that players
can pick up the more they play that help them get a higher score. Ultimately, I want the player to feel the flow of quickly shooting and dodging enemies and the sense of power as they 
increase their focus and use the skills they've learned to get out of those heart-pounding moments when the health is low and the zombies are closing in.
